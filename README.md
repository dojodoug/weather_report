# Weather Report

## Description

This Ruby application is designed to pull data from multiple Weather Underground API endpoints and present a weather report to the user. When the user runs the application, he or she will be asked for a zip code, and the summary will be for that location.

For this project the following data was pulled from the Weather Underground API endpoints.

* Current conditions based on the zip code submitted by the user.
* 10 day forecast for zip code submitted by the user.
* Sunrise and sunset times.
* Any current weather alerts.
* A list of all active hurricanes (anywhere).

## Objectives

This project addresses:

* The purpose and structure of Web APIs.
* JSON structure.
* The ability to access an API using a token.
* The ability to make HTTP requests via HTTParty
* The ability pull and merge information from multiple API endpoints
* The ability to write tests that mock API responses.

## Wherever you may be here's hoping for beautiful weather!
